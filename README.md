#### Introduction
The idea is to overlap wireless signals (in particular the Wi-Fi signals) such that they create a region much larger than their individual one, and without any kind of interferences. Although, the Wi-Fi Protocol is known for becoming very perturbed by the interferences, there is however a lot of potential in utilising newer technologies built on top of existing protocols like **Wi-Fi Direct**.

#### Challenges
The major challenge in doing so is that we must make our Wi-Fi Channels on the target overlapping networks on the same channel in order to achieve maximum connectivity, and it is contrary to the fact that the interferences resulting from the signals on the same channel can dampen each of them by a large extent.
