#### Introduction
The idea is to overlap wireless signals (in particular the Wi-Fi signals) such that they create a region much larger than their individual one, and without any kind of interferences. Although, the Wi-Fi Protocol is known for becoming very perturbed by the interferences, there is however a lot of potential in utilising newer technologies built on top of existing protocols like **Wi-Fi Direct**.
